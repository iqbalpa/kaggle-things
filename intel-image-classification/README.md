# Intel Image Classification

I found this images dataset quite interesting, and I guess it is beginner friendly. That's why I choose this dataset to learn pytorch. 

I created 3 notebooks, each has different CNN models.
1. Plain CNN [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/iqbalpahlevi/plain-cnn)
2. ResNet CNN from scratch (not really scratch because I can use nn.Layers hehe) [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/iqbalpahlevi/resnet-cnn)
3. Pre-trained ResNet50 CNN from PyTorch [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/iqbalpahlevi/pre-trained-resnet)

Pre-Trained CNN produced the highest accuracy, which is around 90%.
