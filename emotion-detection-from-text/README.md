# Emotion Detection from Text

I choose this dataset randomly from kaggle because I think it will be easy to learn NLP from basic task, which is text classification (sentiment analysis). 
Yeah it was easy if I used TfIdf for word embeddings, but it gave really bad scores. Then I decided to use BERT for word embeddings, but turns out that
i have too much data and kaggle couldn't handle it :). I'm done with this. Despite I couldn't finish this task, at least, I quite understand how to do
word embeddings now.
