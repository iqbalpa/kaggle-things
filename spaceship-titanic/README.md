# Spaceship Titanic

Spaceship titanic dataset is quite interesting. If you know about titanic ship, the story of this dataset is similar with that but in the space instead of the sea.

This is a classification task to predict whether the passenger is transported (save) or not. I did some exploratory data analysis and features engineering. 
The model I used are logistic regression, catboost classifier, xgboost classifier, and random forest classifier. 
But I haven't implemented cross validation and hyperparameter tuning yet, because I am too lazy for waiting that long time while model training. 

The highest score I get is _**0.80102**_ using Catboost Classifier
